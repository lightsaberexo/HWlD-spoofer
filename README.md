# HWID

A HWID spoofer for Windows.

There may be some functionality on lower Windows versions, but it was not tested.

The driver handles disk, volume, NIC (+ ARP), SMBIOS, boot, and GPU identifiers.

The usermode program handles registry keys and common tracking files.

# Note

IP, SIDs, and AC/game specific files can still be used to identify you.

NVME specific IOCTLs are not handled.

When using a VPN, load the driver after the VPN's TAP driver is loaded.
